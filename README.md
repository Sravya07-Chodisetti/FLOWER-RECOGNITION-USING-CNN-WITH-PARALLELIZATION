FLOWER RECOGNITION USING CNN WITH PARALLELIZATION TO CALCULATE SPEED-UP &amp; EFFICIENCY

Creating a flower recognition system entails training a machine to identify various types of flowers. When the machine struggles to recognize flowers on its own, we step in to assist by training a dataset. This process involves adapting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a widely used approach in image recognition tasks. CNNs made up of several layers that work together to extract and learn features from images. Hence they are ideal for tasks like object recognition and hence flower recognition. 

Training a CNN can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. Parallelization techniques can significantly speed up the process by distributing the workload across multiple CPUs, GPUs, or even cloud computing resources.
