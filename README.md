FLOWER RECOGNITION USING CNN WITH PARALLELIZATION TO CALCULATE SPEED-UP &amp; EFFICIENCY

Creating a flower recognition system entail training a machine to identify various types of flowers. When the machine struggles to recognize flowers on its own, we step in to assist by training a dataset. This process involves adapting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a widely used approach in image recognition tasks.
The reason for choosing CNNs is that they are made up of several layers that work together to extract and learn features from images. And hence they are ideal for tasks like object recognition and hence flower recognition.
